        This fall is the beginning of the We Ignite Tech program (yay!).

        It is a full stack developer program on speed with the aim to enable newcomers to enter the tech job market faster, as well as helping businesses find new talented techies.

        The program is for people with some prior knowledge and experience with programming, who want to refresh and update their knowledge to meet the requirements of the labour market. This is the first time we’re doing this - so join us and co-create!

        The application process is now closed, but are you, or someone you know the right candidate? Keep reading :)
